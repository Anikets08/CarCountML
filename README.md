# Object Detection and Traffic Signal Simulation

This Python script performs object detection on an image to count the number of cars and simulates a traffic signal based on the count.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Uses `cvlib` to detect common objects in an image.
- **Car Counting**: Counts the number of cars detected in the image.
- **Traffic Signal Simulation**: Simulates a traffic signal delay based on the number of cars detected.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `cvlib`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, `time`, `IPython`

## Installation

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install cvlib opencv-python matplotlib IPython
